# Notion Integration Contract

## Purpose and boundary

The user's personal library in Notion is the intended destination for reading knowledge. [Core behavior](../core.md) remains usable without this integration.

This file defines the integration's required semantics and operational safeguards. It does not implement a connector or prescribe database IDs, API calls, property schemas, or assistant-platform packaging.

## Destination and content roles

Associate each work with the correct record according to existing library conventions. Resolve ambiguity when it could change the writing destination.

Distinguish four content roles:

| Reference section | Function |
| --- | --- |
| About the reading | Context, motivation, expectations, and circumstances |
| Notes | Original records made while reading |
| Reflections | Matured interpretations, connections, changes, and open questions |
| What stayed with me | A selective personal synthesis of what endured |

These are semantic roles, not mandatory headings or a requirement to restructure existing pages or fill empty sections. In the source library they are named `Sobre a leitura`, `Anotações`, `Reflexões`, and `O que ficou comigo`. Preserve existing page language and verify the mapping rather than renaming sections to match this English definition.

When needed, keep the continuity record described in the core separate from original authored content.

## Writing rules

- When the integration is available and the destination is identified, automatically consolidate mature reflections under the approved preference, without requesting permission for every record.
- Immediately honor instructions such as "do not save this conversation."
- Read current content before editing. Avoid duplicates and overwriting recent changes.
- Preserve original notes in full. Do not strike through, correct, or rewrite them to mark progress.
- Update syntheses for the current reflection without erasing meaningful interpretive changes or layers from earlier reading cycles.
- Verify the operation's result before claiming a save. If an operation fails or its outcome is uncertain, keep the pending state explicit and verify before retrying a potentially duplicative write.
- Continue the conversation if the integration is unavailable. When useful, provide a synthesis ready to record. Do not promise future synchronization that has not been implemented.

Deleting content, replacing original notes, or deeply restructuring a page requires specific authorization if it has not already been given.

Do not create a record merely because a work was mentioned. If the user expresses an intention to read without clearly requesting registration, ask whether they want to register it. If registration was already requested, execute without asking again.

## Implementation handoff

A future integration implementation must resolve:

- How to locate the database and correct work pages.
- Property schemas and the meanings of status, dates, and classification.
- Icons and covers under existing conventions.
- Pagination and complete retrieval for the chosen scope.
- Writing operations, result verification, duplicate prevention, and conflict handling.

Names such as `Library`, `Status`, `Reading`, `Read`, `Year`, and `Topics` are conventions of the source implementation, not universal core requirements. Verify their meanings. For example, use `Year` as the first-publication year only if that is the database's actual contract.

Tool selection and authentication belong to the future implementation. It must satisfy this contract without embedding those mechanisms into the core or changing the user's approved persistence preference.
